This is an attempt to apply a mathematical model to US counties to predict the level of support within. This is inspired by many similar things on the internet like:

- https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/24/upshot/facebook-baseball-map.html


#### Things taken into account:
- Popularity of the league
- Long-term establishment of the team. This could called allegiance, equity, etc
    - Teams gain this by over time:
        - Simply existing and having success. 
        - Investing in a good venue helps.

- Short-term enthusiasm
    - Expansion, Relocated teams and teams experiencing success will gain this and eventually lose it when the situation wanes. 

- Distance from venue. Loyalty wanes the further you get from the team.

    - If teams other than the nearest team with have an effective distance that is longer. 

    - Teams in other states will have a effective multiplier.

#### "Fun" I'd like to be able to do
- Model expansion and relocation to see if fans are gained and how existing fan bases might shift
    - Even silly things like major city in Delaware getting teams like the Metropolis Meteors.
- Model what might happen if a league implemented some kind of pro/rel scheme. Enthusiasm for such team would go negative and long term allegiance would to start tp lower if promotion is earned back quickly.

#### Things I'd like to add.
- Residual loyalty to a relocated team like the Raiders in LA.
- In baseball, having a minor league affiliate in a remote county should increase loyalty even over a closer market. 
- "America's Teams": The NY Times maps shows Yankees, Red Sox, Lakers, Heat fandom in remote places. Perhaps there should be a bottom to a teams distance degradation.
- Presences of major college programs in basketball and football could impact pro fandom.
- Competition for the other sports

#### Quirks that likely won't be mitigated.
- Distance is direct "as the crow flies". This leads to quirks where teams in Michigan are more loyal to Green Bay than they likely are. 
- A farther market may be easier to travel to. Springfield Missouri is closer to Kansas City than St. Louis, but has more Cardinals fans. Recently the Cardinal put a AA affiliate there but mostly because I-44.
